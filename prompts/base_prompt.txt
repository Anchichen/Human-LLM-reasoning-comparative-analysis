Role Task: 

You are reasoning through a Zendo task where each panel either follows or violates a rule.
Your goal is to think step-by-step to find out the rule. 
In the task, there are six panels (Panel A to F). Each panel contains a specific arrangement of cones with different features of:

- Color: red, green, blue
- Size: small, medium, large
- Orientation (upright, tilted right/left, lying right/left, upside down)
- Cone relation (e.g. stacked pair - Cone 1 stacks on Cone 2; Cone 2 supports Cone 1)

------
Rule Information: 

Some panels have yellow stars, which indicates that the panel follows the rule. Panels without a star must violate the rule.
For example: Panels A, C, F follow the rule, while Panel B, D, E do not. If the hidden rule is "There should be at least one green cone." In this case, Panels A, C, F should each have one or more green cone, and Panel B, D, E should not have any green cone.

The rule can involve the **COLOR**, **SIZE**, **RELATION**, **count**, or **orientation** of cones. It can also involve the **COMBINATIONS** of these features.
Figure out the hidden rule by comparing the star and non-star panels, and tell the final rule guesses at the end. 
Make sure that the rule is only supported by star panels, and should not applied in non-star panels.

Example of rules: 
- There is a stacked pair in the same color. 
- There are more blue cones than green cones.
- There are three lying red small cones.

Instructions: 

- Think aloud to find the rule, including comparing panels, finding common patterns across panels, forming hypotheses, and more.
- Carefully observe specific cone features in the six panels to uncover pattern.
- Always validate your thoughts with accurate details from the panels (e.g., “Panel A has a red cone and no star…”).
- Check if the hypothesis is contradicted by evidences and revise your ideas. 
- Keep exploring alternative possibilities and more precise explanations. Do not stop at your first guess. 
- At the end, claim the most likely final rules.

------
Important: 

- Think about: What is the common pattern shared by all the star panels, but does not appear in non-star panels?
- Systematically test to make sure every star panels satisfies your rule, and that every non-star panels does not meet the rule. 
- DO NOT merely describe panels. Think aloud like a scientist forming and testing ideas.
- Only describe the scene insofar as it tests your current hypothesis.
- Avoid repeating or paraphrasing earlier observations. Always add something new.

Format:

Label each reasoning step as [T01], [T02], etc. Each step is one thought and should be 1-2 concise sentences.

Example: 
[T01] All of the cones in Panel A are upright, and there is no star.
[T02] Panel B has a green tilted cone and has a star.
[T03] Panel E also has tilted cones and has a star. 
[T04] Maybe the rule is related to tilted cones...
[T05] But Panel C has two tilted cones and no star. So that contradicts the idea.

(Continue until you have refined at least one or two solid and specific hypotheses.)
