1,p1,10,"And then Option F as well, has a bunch of them facing sideways and down.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,17,direct,0,Wrong
1,p1,11,"So nothing really sticks out to me too much based on what I just, what I just saw.",Reflection,reflectUncertainty,20,direct,0,Wrong
1,p1,12,I think maybe there are more unstable triangles in the options with the sun [star lit up].,Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,19,direct,0,Wrong

1,p2,7,"Panels A, E, and F do, ergo, the star is lit up.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,19,direct,1,Correct

1,p2,15,Maybe something to do with the number of cones?,Hypothesis,hypoAlternative,10,direct,1,Correct

1,p2,21,Okay so literally the only thing Im seeing that would govern this hidden rule would be: Does the panel have red cones or not?,DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,27,direct,1,Correct

1,p3,8,"In panel A, all the triangles are pointing up or down.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,13,direct,0,Wrong

1,p6,2,"Actually, no, they don't have two because the B, C and D don't have any red triangles. So that's a possibility too. Like A, E and F have red triangles.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,41,direct,1,Correct
1,p6,3,"Um, one, two, three...one, two... Im counting the amount that is sideways for the triangles through the ones that are lighting up.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,31,direct,1,Correct

1,p6,6,"Okay. So this one has a lot of blue ones next to each other with C. As well as... okay so... but Panel B, A Panel B and A and E and F all have a blue on top of a green one, so that's not something that's important.",Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,59,direct,1,Correct

1,p13,11,Im not sure what else.,Reflection,reflectUncertainty,7,direct,1,Correct
1,p13,12,"I think its definitely something to do with the red ones, because if you look at what A, E and F have in common, they all have a red cone  at least one red cone  and B, C and D do not.",DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,50,direct,1,Correct
1,p13,13,"They also do have a blue cone on top of a green cone,",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,14,direct,1,Correct

1,p15,1,Okay. So three of the puzzles have a yellow star.,ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,12,direct,1,Correct
1,p15,2,"Okay, I'm going to start with the red cones.",Planning,planningStrategic,12,direct,1,Correct
1,p15,3,"In A, there's two red cones. In E, one. In F, two.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,19,direct,1,Correct
1,p15,4,Probably not that one.,Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,5,direct,1,Correct
1,p15,5,"Oh, actually it could be because B, C and D don't have a yellow star and they don't have any red cones.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,27,direct,1,Correct
1,p15,6,That would make sense.,DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,5,direct,1,Correct
1,p15,7,"I'm trying to look for some kind of correlation of direction of the cones, but they're all quite random.",Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,23,direct,1,Correct

1,p15,10,"F, again varying directions.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,6,direct,1,Correct

1,p15,12,That seems to make sense because there's no other correlation in terms of direction or size of cones.,Evaluation/Monitoring,monitorHighLevel,20,direct,1,Correct
1,p15,13,So I think that's the rule. That you get a yellow star if there's a red cone present.,DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,22,direct,1,Correct

1,p16,3,"Um, I'm seeing red here, red here and red here.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,14,direct,1,Correct
1,p16,4,"Could that be it? Right off the bat. If there's a red one, it's a star.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,22,direct,1,Correct
1,p16,5,"Let me see if there's anything else, though.",Planning,planningExplorative,11,direct,1,Correct
1,p16,6,Um. 3-6-7... 1-2-3-4-5.,ProcessingScope,processingLocal,20,direct,1,Correct

1,p16,10,So it could also be if there's more than...if there's greater than five triangles.,Hypothesis,hypoRevision,19,direct,1,Correct
1,p16,11,Because F obviously has more than five. E has six cones. 3-4-5-6-7 in A.,Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,26,direct,1,Correct
1,p16,12,So I have two.,Evaluation/Monitoring,monitorHighLevel,5,direct,1,Correct

1,p17,1,"Okay, so I'm trying to infer the hidden rule.",Orientation,Orientation,12,inferred,1,Correct
1,p17,2,"Let's look at the stars here. Um, so we have A, E, and F.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,20,direct,1,Correct

1,p17,11,"Um, hm. That's interesting. I'm trying to work out what it could be, to be honest.",Reflection,reflectUncertainty,23,direct,1,Correct
1,p17,12,"So, E has three greens, A has three greens, and F has three greens.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,18,direct,1,Correct
1,p17,13,"Um, so I think that might be something to do with it. That could be the hidden rule.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,21,direct,1,Correct

1,p18,5,"D has blue and green, no red.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,9,direct,1,Correct

1,p18,7,F has all three colors and the star.,ProcessingScope,processingLocal,9,direct,1,Correct

1,p19,3,"Also, there's a panel E, which has again, a few tilted, big and small cones.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,21,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,4,So it feels like maybe the cones need to be upright.,Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,12,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,5,"I can also see in panel A, there's two reds, and in panel F, there's also two red cones, but they are tilted compared to panel A. And panel E only has one red cone which is tilted.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,47,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,6,"So, I feel it might be a combination of there being too many cones in panel... in the other panels, where obviously there's a bit of a difference.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,33,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,7,"So maybe they all need to be upright, instead of being tilted or vice versa.",Hypothesis,hypoRevision,17,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,8,"But then also looking at the other panels...which are panel B, C, and D, they all have tilted and upright cone, but they all are in green or blue.",Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,36,direct,0,Wrong

1,p19,10,"But then again, panel A have them upright and panel E and F don't.",Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,17,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,11,"So, it could be a color combination. If it's nothing to do with it being upright or tilted, it could be a color combination or there's more than... one amount of color, or there's more colors in others than there are in some.",Hypothesis,hypoRevision,52,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,12,"So, I feel that there's definitely something to do with the panel B, C, and D not having red cones.",DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,25,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,13,"Um, it doesn't really matter, I feel, whether they're big or small, tilted or upright.",Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,22,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,14,"And also I feel it could be to do with color combination, as well. Maybe the sizing of the cones could also be a reason, within this.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,31,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,15,So in panel A and F I see this more cones...compared to panel E which has the yellow star.,ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,23,direct,0,Wrong

1,p19,17,"Yeah. So, I feel that that would be a reason to believe that... the color combination is definitely a factor, I feel.",DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,27,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,18,"I feel like that's mainly what I can see the difference between panels A, E and F and D, B and C. That they don't have any red cones. So I feel like red is definitely a factor within this.",DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,47,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,19,"So, um, in E and F, there are more smaller cones than there are in D and B.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,22,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,20,There are a few big ones and small ones in C compared to D and B.,ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,17,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,21,But F has the most cones from the six panels that I can see.,ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,15,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,22,"Um, so I do feel it could be to do with the color combinations as well as the size of the cones and possibly how many...cones there are within each panel.",Hypothesis,hypoRevision,36,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,23,"Apart from that, the only other thing I can see is panel D has a smaller cone on top of a larger blue cone,",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,26,direct,0,Wrong

1,p19,25,So definitely feeling more towards a number of things. Colors. I feel being tilted. Some having a cone on top of a cone and some not having many reds or not having reds at all.,Reflection,reflectCertainty,41,unmapped_ai_assigned,0,Wrong
1,p19,26,"Also, um...some of the... So, in B, C, and D, there's no red cones. So, I also do feel that maybe there needs to be upright cones in there of red.",Hypothesis,hypoRevision,43,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,27,"Um, possibly being upright the way they are in panel A. Or then actually, in...E and F, they are tilted but in A it's upright.",Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,34,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,28,"So, I definitely feel that it does... I do feel it's definitely to do with color combination, not having any red cones, whether they're tilted or upright, big or small, in B, C and D.",DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,45,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,29,"I don't feel as much now looking more closely that it's to do with the amount of cones you have, but more of the color combination not being there...",Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,33,direct,0,Wrong
1,p19,30,"because if you see an A, E and F, there's no... cones on top of a cone, whichever color.

1,p20,5,"And I'm referring to them as funnels, I sometimes call them triangles as well because I'm referring to the same thing, because to me they look like both triangles and funnels. So that's why I use that term interchangeably.",Reflection,reflectTask,49,direct,1,Correct
1,p20,6,"And as far as the rule goes, I am not sure if it has to do with the triangles being inside of another blue triangle because I see that some of the green triangles are inside of the blue triangles.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,42,direct,1,Correct
1,p20,7,I do notice that there's some red triangles in some of these panels.,ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,15,direct,1,Correct
1,p20,8,And I do notice that the yellow stars have red triangles in them for the panels that have red triangles in them.,ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,23,direct,1,Correct
1,p20,9,"So, my guess is that the panels which contain red funnels are the panels which have...are the reason why those panels have yellow stars is because they include red triangles in them.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,37,direct,1,Correct
1,p20,10,"[TYPING] So I think that the hidden rule is any panel which has a red funnel in it will also have a yellow star in it because as I said, the panels with the red funnels in them all have yellow stars in it...and all of the panels, which don't have a yellow star in it,  don't have red funnels in them.",DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,76,direct,1,Correct

1,p23,7,Let's start by looking at the number of cones in each panel.,Planning,planningStrategic,14,direct,1,Correct
1,p23,8,"So, panel A has two cones, has a star, panel B has two cones and has a star. Panel C has two cones, has a star. Panel D has three cones, no star. Panel E has three cones, no star. Panel F has two cones and has a star.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,60,direct,1,Correct

1,p23,11,"Okay, so B red and red, same colors. C, blue and blue, same colors. F, red and blue, different colors. D is green, blue, red, all different colors. E is red, green, blue, so they're all different colors,",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,56,direct,1,Correct

1,p23,23,"Ooh, a little bit confusing, but I got it.",Reflection,reflectSelf,13,direct,1,Correct
1,p24,1,"Okay, so I see there are three panels that have yellow stars, A, E and F.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,20,direct,1,Correct

1,p24,9,"One, two, three, four…seven.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,10,direct,1,Correct

1,p26,16,So I would imagine that is probably the solution.,Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,10,direct,1,Correct
1,p26,17,"And there's only three colors: green, blue and red.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,13,direct,1,Correct
1,p26,18,"And that seems to be what sticks out the most, is the use of red triangles.",DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,18,direct,1,Correct
1,p26,19,"If it has a red cone in it, then it is a lit up star.",FinalRule,ruleArticulation,17,direct,1,Correct
1,p27,1,"So, um, A, E and F all have, um, yellow stars. They, uh, all have one purple [blue] and green triangle that's upright. Um, and also they have pink [red] cones.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,47,direct,1,Correct
1,p27,2,"Um, the others [panels] that don't have the yellow stars, don't have pink [red] cones.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,24,direct,1,Correct

1,p27,4,"Um, or maybe just pink [red] because the others seem to have purple [blue].",Hypothesis,hypoAlternative,19,direct,1,Correct

1,p27,10,And it doesn't look like there's any of those in the ones with the yellow stars.,Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,19,direct,1,Correct

1,p38,9,That's consistent and...reverse-checking for lack of red....means stars not lit up.,DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,19,direct,1,Correct

3,p7,9,"Oh, okay! I think Ive got it.",Reflection,reflectSelf,11,direct,1,Correct

3,p8,13,"I suppose it's worth noting that F is all horizontal, none of them are upright.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,18,direct,1,Correct

3,p20,4,"I noticed that there's blue funnels, red funnels, green funnels in this image.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,20,direct,1,Correct
3,p20,5,"And I think... yeah, all of these panels have green, blue and red colored funnels in them, from what I can see here.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,29,direct,1,Correct
3,p20,6,And I notice that the triangles are facing upwards. Some of them are in panel E.,ProcessingScope,processingLocal,18,direct,1,Correct

3,p20,8,"And I notice that the panels with a white star in them, such as panels D, E and B, they have... well, panel E has one blue funnel in it which is facing to the right.

And then panel E has a blue funnel in it which is facing left.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,79,direct,1,Correct

3,p21,1,"Okay. So, let's see.",Planning,planningExplorative,8,direct,1,Correct
3,p21,2,"So, A, C, and F. (4.5)",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,14,direct,1,Correct
3,p21,3,"So, the similar similarities I could see in between A, C, and F, F in particular, is that there is...that there's two blue cones in each one of these labels, A, C and F, and they are slanted.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,51,direct,1,Correct
3,p21,4,"So, obviously they're misaligned, and they're both kind of...they're all misaligned in this instance.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,24,direct,1,Correct
3,p21,5,"Whereas you've got, in B, D and E, you've got either blue cones in this instance that are upright or there's only one contained.",Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,32,direct,1,Correct
3,p21,6,"So, I think that is the hidden rule in this scenario, that A, C and F all contain blue cones.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,24,direct,1,Correct
3,p21,7,There's two each... in each of the labels.,Hypothesis,hypoRevision,11,direct,1,Correct
3,p21,8,"And they are slanted, so they're misaligned and none of them are straight in this instance or upright.",Hypothesis,hypoRevision,23,direct,1,Correct
3,p21,9,"So, I think that is the hidden rule in regards to this scenario.",DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,15,direct,1,Correct
3,p21,10,I can't actually see anything else that may indicate that another rule might be present in this instance.,Reflection,reflectUncertainty,20,direct,1,Correct

3,p21,12,"And there has to be two or more present in each label, whereas label E, for example, only has one blue cone misaligned.",Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,28,direct,1,Correct
3,p21,13,"So, yeah, that's why that one isn't similar to A, C, and F.",Evaluation/Monitoring,monitorHighLevel,20,direct,1,Correct
3,p21,14,"So once again, I think, in A, C, and F, the hidden rule in this agenda is there has to be two or more blue cones present, and they have to be misaligned and slanted.",FinalRule,ruleArticulation,44,direct,1,Correct
3,p22,1,"Okay, so with this one it's A, C, and F.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,15,direct,1,Correct
3,p22,2,I guess there's five in each of... each of them.,ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,13,direct,1,Correct
3,p22,3,"Although let me just... let me actually count here because this one has one, two, three, four, five, six. So, this actually has more than five. This one has five. And this one has I think also five.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,49,direct,1,Correct
3,p22,4,"But since C has six, it's not the number of cones.",Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,14,direct,1,Correct
3,p22,5,"A has one green, C has three greens, F has one green.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,15,direct,1,Correct
3,p22,6,"I'm trying to find something that's in common between, you know, the three starred ones.",Planning,planningExplorative,20,direct,1,Correct
3,p22,7,"Two reds in A, two reds in F, one red in C.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,17,direct,1,Correct
3,p22,8,"I think in A, C, and F, I see two blue cones that are kind of on their sides, on the ground, because A has that, C has that, and F has that too.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,42,direct,1,Correct
3,p22,9,"Whereas if I look at B, E, and D, I see one blue cone on the side in B, but one is standing up; one is on the side in E and that's it. There's no other blue cone. And then in D, one is tilted, the other standing up, and the tilted one's not on the ground completely either.",Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,75,direct,1,Correct
3,p22,10,So that's kind of my best guess so far.,DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,11,direct,1,Correct
3,p22,11,Other than that... let's see.,Planning,planningExplorative,8,direct,1,Correct
3,p22,12,"Green is standing up in all, well, except F, so I don't think that's the rule.",Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,22,direct,1,Correct
3,p22,13,"And then the red ones, they're also kind of standing up in A, but not in C and not in F, so I don't think that's what it is either.",Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,37,direct,1,Correct
3,p22,14,"So yeah, I can't really think of anything else that they have in common that the other ones B and D don't have.",Reflection,reflectUncertainty,27,direct,1,Correct
3,p22,15,"So, I think my guess is that there are two blue cones on their sides, on the floor.",FinalRule,ruleArticulation,21,direct,1,Correct
3,p22,16,That's really the only rule I can think of here.,DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,12,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,1,So next I'm going to observe all of these real quick before I start talking.,Planning,planningExplorative,17,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,2,"So, I'm just looking over A, B, C, D and E and F and trying to understand that currently",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,25,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,3,Wait a minute. Why does A have...,Reflection,reflectUncertainty,9,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,4,Okay. I'm going to list the panels with a star and without again.,Planning,planningStrategic,16,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,5,"So, the panels with stars are B, C and E and no stars are A, D and F.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,22,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,6,Panel A has no stars but has two conesgreen and redwhich are different colors. They're both small and both tilted.,ProcessingScope,processingLocal,26,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,7,"Panel B has a star, two conesred and greenwhich are different colors, both large and both tilted.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,23,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,8,"Panel C has two conesblue and greenwhich are different colors, both small and both upright.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,20,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,9,"Panel D has no stars, two conesblue and bluesame colors.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,16,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,10,Wait. Panel D has got me confused.,Reflection,reflectUncertainty,9,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,11,"Okay, so Panel D two conesblue and bluesame colors, one small and one large.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,21,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,12,"So that would be. How would I word that? Mixed sizes, both tilted?",Reflection,reflectUncertainty,17,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,13,"Uh, Panel E has a star, two conesred and bluewhich are different colors, both large, both upright.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,25,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,14,"Panel F, no star, two conesblue and reddifferent colors, one small and one large. So mixed sizes, both upright.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,29,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,15,Now I'm going to look for patterns.,Planning,planningStrategic,9,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,16,"So, all panels have two cones.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,8,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,17,So that's obviously not the rule.,Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,8,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,18,"Colors are the same and different. So starred panels have different colors, so B, C and E. Non-starred panels have the same or different colors, A and F.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,36,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,19,"So, in my opinion there's no clear rule here. None at all.",Reflection,reflectUncertainty,16,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,20,"Uh, this is confusing me. I need one second.",Reflection,reflectUncertainty,12,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,21,"So, the orientation, I guess, is how you would word that宇hey're both tilted for A, no star. B star, D, no star, which is inconsistent in my opinion. And then both upright for C, star; E, star; F, no star, which is inconsistent.",Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,62,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,22,So that alone isn't the rule. Right? Yeah.,DecisionMaking,decisionReject,12,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,23,Now we're going to go to size.,Planning,planningStrategic,9,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,24,"Panel D and F have mixed sizes, one small and one large. And neither one of them has a star.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,23,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,25,"That's a strong candidate for the part of the rule, if that makes sense.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,17,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,26,"So, if the cones are of mixed sizes, there's no star.",Hypothesis,hypoRevision,15,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,27,"This means for a panel to have a star, the cones must be the same size. Either both small or large. Right?",Hypothesis,hypoRevision,26,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,28,Now let's look at the panels that have the same size.,Planning,planningStrategic,13,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,29,"So that would be panel A, B, C and... E, right? Yeah.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,18,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,30,"Okay. So A is both small and both tilted. So, with that together that means that there is no star.",Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,24,direct,1,Correct
3,p23,31,"And for panel B is both large and both tilted, that would be a star.",Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,17,direct,1,Correct

3,p23,37,The cones must not be of mixed sizes.,Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,9,direct,1,Correct

3,p23,41,"So, if we put this together as a rule, it would be: a star appears if the cones are the same size and they are not both small and both tilted. So, I guess in simple terms, the star does not appear if the cones are mixed sizes. The star also does not appear if the cones are both small and both tilted. Also, the panel does not have cones of mixed sizes, and the cones are not both small and both tilted. So that explains all the panels.",FinalRule,ruleArticulation,101,direct,1,Correct

3,p28,11,But I think that is my best guess...because I can't...okay...,DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,16,direct,1,Correct
3,p28,12,Because the only way the tilting...the tilting angle doesn't deliver here in B.,Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,19,direct,1,Correct
3,p28,13,"But what I can acknowledge is if there is the presence of two tilted blue cones, there's a star.",FinalRule,ruleArticulation,22,direct,1,Correct

3,p30,9,So maybe it's that you can't have two of the same color next to each other...,Hypothesis,hypoRevision,19,direct,1,Correct
3,p30,10,and because B has green on top of blue and it's next to the end...,ProcessingScope,processingLocal,17,direct,1,Correct
3,p30,11,then I'm going to assume that that is the key for this one.,DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,15,direct,1,Correct
3,p30,12,That there has to be a gap between the colors. Or there can't be any duplicate colors next to each other.,FinalRule,ruleArticulation,24,direct,1,Correct

3,p31,6,Can't be two...,Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,5,direct,1,Correct

4,p5,9,This time the rule is: you need a same-size cone stacked on top of each other.,Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,19,direct,1,Correct

4,p16,6,"Um, okay. Two triangles, two upright triangles of different colors stacked on each other.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,18,direct,1,Correct
4,p16,7,"I feel like that is likely it, but I will keep looking.",DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,14,direct,1,Correct
4,p16,8,"(9.0) Other than that... I feel like that's going to be it, because A has the red on top of the green, C has the green on top of the blue, and F has the red on top of the blue.",Reflection,ruleConfidence,51,unmapped_ai_assigned,1,Correct
4,p16,9,"E is the only other one with triangles stacked upright, but they're both blue.",Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,17,direct,1,Correct
4,p16,10,"Well, actually I think B has two greens stacked maybe. But again, they're the same color.",Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,21,direct,1,Correct
4,p16,11,So I feel like that is going to be my guess because I'm not really seeing anything else standing out to me.,FinalRule,ruleArticulation,24,direct,1,Correct
4,p16,12,"Other than that, anything else consistent.",Evaluation/Monitoring,monitorHighLevel,8,direct,1,Correct
4,p16,13,"I did not count them, however.",Evaluation/Monitoring,monitorLowLevel,8,direct,1,Correct
4,p16,14,"Let me see. Seven in A, six in B, seven in C, looks like seven in F.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,22,direct,1,Correct
4,p16,15,"Five in E, but again there's seven in D, so it's not the number.",Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,19,direct,1,Correct
4,p16,16,So it's got to be two different... [TYPING] two different colored upright cones stacked on each other.,FinalRule,ruleArticulation,24,direct,1,Correct
4,p17,1,Okay. So now we're looking at another rule.,Orientation,Orientation,11,inferred,1,Correct
4,p17,2,"So we're looking at panel A, firsthand.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,10,direct,1,Correct
4,p17,3,Um now let's compare it with panel C.,Planning,planningBasicComparison,10,direct,1,Correct
4,p17,4,"So, is it something to do with colors maybe?",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,11,direct,1,Correct
4,p17,5,"Okay, no, we can clearly see that it's not because there's three red triangles in F. So, that means they don't match up.",DecisionMaking,decisionReject,31,direct,1,Correct
4,p17,6,Um is it maybe a numbers thing.,Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,8,direct,1,Correct
4,p17,7,"So, A has 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. C has 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. F has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,62,direct,1,Correct
4,p17,8,Okay. Now let me look at the other ones [counting under breath].,Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,16,direct,1,Correct
4,p17,9,"Mm okay, I thought that might be correct, but panel D was at seven. So that means that isn't the hidden rule.",DecisionMaking,decisionReject,28,direct,1,Correct
4,p17,10,"So, we look to something else.",changePlan,modifyPlan,8,direct,1,Correct
4,p17,11,"Could it be having, um, triangles stacked on each other.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,13,direct,1,Correct

4,p18,5,"Um, three blues...two...no.",Evaluation/Monitoring,monitorLowLevel,9,direct,1,Correct
4,p18,6,"So, panel D has three blues, two reds and two greens.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,15,direct,1,Correct
4,p18,7,"So, it's not the color distribution.",Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,9,direct,1,Correct

4,p18,20,"There's one, two, three, four...four in panel F, only two in panel C,",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,21,direct,1,Correct
4,p18,21,so that's not either.,Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,6,direct,1,Correct
4,p18,22,"Um, there's three in panel A, as well.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,12,direct,1,Correct
4,p18,23,"Uh, stacked triangles, but they have to differ in color.",FinalRule,ruleArticulation,13,direct,1,Correct
4,p19,1,"Okay. So again, we're looking at A, C, and F.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,16,direct,0,Wrong
4,p19,2,They've got a mix of cones.,ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,8,direct,0,Wrong
4,p19,3,"In A, C, and D sorry, in A, C, and F, they have got tilted cones.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,24,direct,0,Wrong

4,p19,7,"E's got one red and D's got two red cones, one small, one big.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,19,direct,0,Wrong
4,p19,8,Um. So possibly it could be that...there is a bit off color combination issue with B and E.,Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,22,direct,0,Wrong
4,p19,9,"Um, maybe cones need to be more tilted in B, E and D because they're more upright.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,21,direct,0,Wrong
4,p19,10,"Maybe... the smaller cones need to be on top of each other, like in C.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,18,direct,0,Wrong
4,p19,11,Or then maybe... yeah. So it could be that D is more tilted.,DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,16,direct,0,Wrong
4,p19,12,"But then it could be there's a cone on top of a cone, the way it's in C.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,22,direct,0,Wrong
4,p19,13,It doesn't really matter. I feel whether it's two same color cones or two different color cones.,Hypothesis,hypoRevision,21,direct,0,Wrong
4,p19,14,"Um, maybe there's not a balance between upright and tilted cones. Large and small cones.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,19,direct,0,Wrong
4,p19,15,"[TYPING] Something to do with cones on top of cones. Color combinations. Cones being more balanced between all colors, big or small.",FinalRule,ruleGuess,30,direct,0,Wrong
4,p20,1,"So, the first thing that I notice here is that panels B, D and E have...they have white stars in them.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,26,direct,1,Correct
4,p20,2,"And the next thing I noticed is that panels A, C and F have yellow stars in them.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,20,direct,1,Correct

4,p20,6,"So, I notice that there's two blue funnels, two red funnels in panel A, I noticed that there's two red funnels and three blue funnels in panel C. So two, two or two, three, two would be red, blue green here, two reds, three blues, two greens. And then panel A has two blues, three greens, two reds. Panel D has three blues, two reds and two greens. Panel E has three blues, one red and one green. Panel B has two blues, three greens and one red. So, panel F has two blues, three reds and two greens.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,134,direct,1,Correct
4,p20,7,So I'm going to have to think about this one because I'm not sure as of yet when I'm going to guess the hidden rule is. I'm still unsure of what to guess here.,Reflection,reflectUncertainty,40,direct,1,Correct
4,p20,8,"Um Right, left...panel A there's a right facing funnel and a left facing funnel. Right facing funnel and left facing funnel on panel C.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,31,direct,1,Correct
4,p20,9,"Oh, but there's a panel with the white star that has a right and left facing funnel, as well.",Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,23,direct,1,Correct
4,p20,10,"Um... so, there are two small funnels in A. two small funnels in C. And two small funnels in F.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,28,direct,1,Correct
4,p20,11,"So, I'm going to guess that... [TYPING] I think that the hidden rule is that a panel will have a yellow star in it if there are at least two of the smallest size funnels in it.",FinalRule,ruleGuess,46,direct,1,Correct
4,p21,1,"Okay. So, just trying to see the similarities out of A, C, and F here.",Planning,planningExplorative,20,direct,1,Correct
4,p21,2,"So I think, obviously from what I've inspected here, A, C, and F contain a triangle on top of one another.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,27,direct,1,Correct
4,p21,3,"So, for example, you can see on label A, there's a small red triangle on top of a green triangle, kind of like in the center of that panel.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,35,direct,1,Correct
4,p21,4,"Uh, label C indicates a blue triangle on top of a green triangle, just near to the middle right of the actual panel.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,26,direct,1,Correct
4,p21,5,And label F contains a red triangle on top of a blue cone.,ProcessingScope,processingLocal,14,direct,1,Correct
4,p21,6,So that is the similarities I can see within this task.,Evaluation/Monitoring,monitorHighLevel,12,direct,1,Correct
4,p21,7,"Again, on version B, for example, there's not really a different color...or different cone color coordination on top of one another.",Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,28,direct,1,Correct
4,p21,8,"There's two green cones on top of each other there, so that doesn't count.",Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,18,direct,1,Correct
4,p21,9,"Label D doesn't have any cones on top of each other at all, so that one has been singled out as well.",Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,25,direct,1,Correct
4,p21,10,"And version E does have, once again, two blue cones on top of each other, but they're the same color.",Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,25,direct,1,Correct
4,p21,11,"So, I think the hidden rule in this agenda is... that label A, C, and F contain... is that you have to have one cone on top of each other, and it has to be a different color.",FinalRule,ruleArticulation,45,direct,1,Correct
4,p21,12,"So, yeah, once again, one cone has to be on top of another and it has to be a different color scheme.",FinalRule,ruleArticulation,26,direct,1,Correct
4,p21,13,"So, I think that is the hidden rule in this, uh, scenario.",DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,16,direct,1,Correct
4,p22,1,"Okay. So, it's A, C, and F.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,13,direct,0,Wrong
4,p22,2,"Let's see. So, number of cones I can already see that there's a lot of cones in the uh in the ones that are starred.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,30,direct,0,Wrong

4,p22,4,"So, they all have seven.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,7,direct,0,Wrong
4,p22,5,"So let me look at the other ones actually in B, E, and D because B has one, two, three, four, five... one, two, three, four, five, six in B. One, two, three, four, five in E. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven in D.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,72,direct,0,Wrong
4,p22,6,"So that kind of throws that theory out the window there. So, it's not the number of cones.",Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,22,direct,0,Wrong
4,p22,7,Um let's see. How about in terms of like...number of colors.,changePlan,modifyPlan,16,direct,0,Wrong
4,p22,8,"Because A has two reds, C has two reds and F has three reds.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,19,direct,0,Wrong
4,p22,9,So that's not what it is either.,Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,9,direct,0,Wrong
4,p22,10,"There's three greens in A, two greens in C, so that already kind of throws out the window again.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,23,direct,0,Wrong

4,p22,12,"And then blue is also. Yeah, different amount in C, three, compared to the other ones. So, it's not that either.",Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,29,direct,0,Wrong
4,p22,13,Um let's see then. What else could it be.,Planning,planningExplorative,12,direct,0,Wrong
4,p22,14,"Trying to think... it seems like... there is a... Two small ones here with... that are kind of stacked. Two small ones here that are stacked in C. I should say two small ones that are stacked in A, two small ones that are stacked in C, but two big ones that are stacked in F.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,65,direct,0,Wrong
4,p22,15,So that's not what it is.,Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,8,direct,0,Wrong
4,p22,16,"There are...there is a big red one... big red cone and a big green cone. And then there are some in C as well. Big red one. Big green one and red. Um, and C also has that. And F also has that too.",Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,54,direct,0,Wrong
4,p22,17,But I can also see that like D has that Well D actually doesn't have that. I don't think B has that either. Or E.,Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,31,direct,0,Wrong

4,p22,20,I don't think the other ones have that.,DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,10,direct,0,Wrong

4,p23,2,"Let's look over A, B oh okay. A, C and F",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,18,direct,1,Correct

4,p23,4,First we're going to do what I normally do: we're going to identify which panels have a star and which don't.,Planning,planningStrategic,26,direct,1,Correct
4,p23,5,"So after going through the panels, panels with a star are B, D, and F and panels without a star are A, C and E.",ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,30,direct,1,Correct
4,p23,6,So all panels have three cones.,ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,7,direct,1,Correct
4,p23,7,So obviously the number of cones is not a rule.,Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,11,direct,1,Correct
4,p23,8,And also all the panels have two cones of one color and one color of another color.,ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,18,direct,1,Correct

4,p23,24,"So, panel B, panel F, which in my opinion that looks pretty consistent.",DecisionMaking,decisionConfirm,17,direct,1,Correct
4,p23,25,"And then you also got the cones that are red. So, panel C... does not get a star and the color is red.",ProcessingScope,processingLocal,27,direct,1,Correct
4,p23,26,"Then you move on to the cones that are green which is panel A, panel D and panel E and... they're green but it only gets a star if all the cones are large. So, panel D is large and has a star, but A and E are small and do not have stars. Hm.",Hypothesis,hypoRevision,64,direct,1,Correct

4,p23,37,Definitely the orientation is irrelevant in my opinion.,Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,10,direct,1,Correct

4,p24,7,"But in other ones where they're stacked like an E, there's a blue stacked on top of a blue, but the blue isn't highlighted. Um, so it doesn't apply to the rule.",Evaluation/Monitoring,counterExampleSearch,41,direct,1,Correct

5,p32,10,Is it red then blue?,Hypothesis,hypoGeneration,6,direct,1,Correct
5,p32,11,"It can't because panel B does not have a red and blue overlapping, so..",Evaluation/Monitoring,ruleExclusion,17,direct,1,Correct

5,p32,13,They have overlapping again. Three blues. There's one blue. Two greens. Two greens.,ProcessingScope,processingGlobal,19,direct,1,Correct
